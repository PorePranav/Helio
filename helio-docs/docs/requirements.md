## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Helio is a standalone web-based portal designed to manage reimbursements and vendor payments for events organized by ACM. It acts as a centralized system where invitees and vendors can submit their claims, upload relevant documents, and track the approval and payment status.
